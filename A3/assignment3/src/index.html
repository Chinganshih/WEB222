      <h3>The fact of Blue Jay!</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">
        Blue Jays have a complex social structure and tight family ties, and they are known for
        their intelligence. <br />Jays are also called jaybirds because of their noise; it has been
        applied to other birds in the same family that are mostly gregarious. <br /><abbr
          title="also called Cyanocitta cristata"
          >Blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata)</abbr
        >
        is a bird in the family Corvidae found in eastern North America. <br />It is found primarily
        in eastern and central United States. <br />Some eastern populations may migrate. There are
        also resident populations in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found throughout
        southern Canada. <br />Both deciduous and coniferous forests are breeding grounds, and it is
        common in suburban areas. <br />This animal's coloration is primarily blue, with a white
        chest and underparts, as well as a blue crest. <br />Its neck is covered with a U-shaped
        collar, with a black border around it. <br />Females and males are similar in appearance,
        and their plumage doesn't change during the year. <br />Several subspecies are known. A blue
        jay prefers seeds and nuts, such as acorns, soft fruits, arthropods, and small vertebrates.

          Typically, it eats from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes it hunts insects.
        </strong>
        <br />Other birds have been decapitated by blue jays; they sometimes raid nests and raid
        nests of other birds.

    <h3>Voice:</h3>
    <p>There are also a variety of other calls blue jays use occasionally, such as <em style="color: firebrick;">a mellow whistle, kloo-loo-loo, and a soft, melodious song</em> sung along with a warbling sound during courtship. <br>To warn other birds and
        mammals of an approaching predator, it often issues loud cries, and these cries are often without apparent reason. <br>The sound of the Blue Jay is described as being like a "steel-cold scream," sometimes referred to as <em style="color: firebrick;">"thief," "jay," or "peer."</em>        The Blue Jay’s call is a familiar woodland sound in eastern North America.</p>

    <h3>Behavior:</h3>
    <p>A variety of blue jay calls carry over long distances. Jays usually make their calls while perched within trees. <br>Usually flies across open areas silently, especially during migration. Food is stored in the throat pouch, then removed to be eaten
        elsewhere.
        <br>When eating, it holds a seed or nut in its feet and pecks it open.</p>

    <p>A blue jay communicates with another through both voice and body language. Birds hold down their crest when incubating, feeding nestlings, and associating with mates, families, or flock mates. <br>The streamlined crest represents a bird's reduced
        aggression level. <br>Blue Jays tend to squawk more when their crests are held up; when they squawk the crest is nearly always raised. <br>They have an extensive range of vocalizations.</p>

    <p>Approximately three to four acorns are stored in the bird's throat, one in their mouth, and one in the tip of its bill. <br>In this way they can carry off 5 acorns at a time to store for later feeding.</p>
    <p>The female broods the nestlings for the first 8-12 days after they hatch, and the male provides food for both he and his mate. <br>Following this point, females and males share food gathering, but male provide more food. <br>A few days before the
        brood flies, some nestlings begin wandering 15 feet from the nest.</p>
